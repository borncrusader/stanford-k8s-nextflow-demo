## About
This demo uses [MiniFold](https://github.com/hypnopump/MiniFold) to demonstrate
a protein structure prediction (also known as Protein Folding) from a sequence
of polypeptides.

## Installation
To successfully run this demo, you will need to install the following software
on your machine. All these are available on Windows, macOS and Linux.

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
3. [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

You don't have to be a master of the command line but you should know how to
use a command line and run some simple commands.

## Data Preparation
The demo utilizes data from the venerable
[proteinnet](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet) database. We'll be
using the
[CASP7](https://sharehost.hms.harvard.edu/sysbio/alquraishi/proteinnet/human_readable/casp7.tar.gz)
test data for our demo. Please download this archive and uncompress the
`.tar.gz` file in the `data/` directory. Alternatively, you can use the
[scripts/00_download_data.sh](scripts/00_download_data.sh) to download and
extract this data for you from the command line.
